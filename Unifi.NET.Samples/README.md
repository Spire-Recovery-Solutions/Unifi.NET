# UniFi.NET SDK Samples

This project contains sample applications demonstrating how to use the UniFi.NET SDK libraries.

## UniFi Access Sample

The UniFi Access sample is a console application that demonstrates key features of the UniFi Access SDK including:

- User management (create, list, update)
- NFC card enrollment and assignment
- PIN code generation and assignment
- Device discovery and management

### Prerequisites

1. **UniFi Access Console**: You need access to a UniFi Access console (v1.9.1 or later)
2. **API Token**: Generate an API token from your UniFi Access console
3. **.NET 9 SDK**: Install the .NET 9 SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)

### Getting Started

1. Build the project:
```bash
~/.dotnet/dotnet build Unifi.NET.Samples.csproj
```

2. Run the sample:
```bash
~/.dotnet/dotnet run
```

3. When prompted, enter:
   - Your UniFi Access console URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100:12445`)
   - Your API token

### Features

#### 1. Create New User
Create a new user with basic information:
- First and last name (required)
- Email address (optional)
- Employee ID (optional)

#### 2. List All Users
View all users in the system with:
- User details (name, email, status)
- Number of assigned NFC cards
- PIN code status

#### 3. Register NFC Card
Interactive NFC card enrollment:
- Select a user to assign the card to
- Choose an NFC-capable device (UAH or UAHP)
- Follow on-screen instructions to tap the card
- Automatic card detection and assignment

#### 4. Assign PIN Code
Assign a PIN code to a user:
- Generate a random secure PIN
- Or specify a custom PIN (4-8 digits)
- PIN is displayed for secure distribution to the user

#### 5. List Devices
View all UniFi Access devices:
- Device name and type
- Location information
- Model and version details
- Adoption status

### Native AOT Compilation

This sample supports Native AOT compilation for improved performance and reduced memory usage:

```bash
# Publish for Linux
~/.dotnet/dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64

# Publish for Windows
~/.dotnet/dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

# Publish for macOS (Apple Silicon)
~/.dotnet/dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64
```

### Security Notes

- The sample disables SSL certificate validation by default for development
- In production, set `ValidateSslCertificate = true`
- Store API tokens securely (use environment variables or secure configuration)
- Never commit API tokens to source control

### Troubleshooting

#### Connection Issues
- Verify the console URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the API token is valid
- Ensure port 12445 is not blocked by firewall

#### NFC Card Enrollment
- Ensure the selected device supports NFC (UAH or UAHP models)
- Card must be tapped within 60 seconds of session creation
- Only one enrollment session can be active at a time

#### API Errors
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Verify user has appropriate permissions
- Ensure UniFi Access version is 1.9.1 or later

### Example Output
